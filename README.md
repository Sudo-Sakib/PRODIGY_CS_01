# Caesar Cipher Program

## Overview
This project is an advanced implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This program allows users to:
- Encrypt a message
- Decrypt a message
- Perform multiple operations interactively

This project was completed as part of the internship tasks provided by **Prodigy Infotech** Internship Opportunities.


## Features
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Supports both operations with ease.
- **Preserves Case and Symbols**: Retains the case of letters (uppercase/lowercase) and keeps non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
- **Interactive Menu**: Allows users to perform multiple operations without restarting the program.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures valid input for shift values and prevents unexpected crashes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides detailed feedback and clear instructions throughout the process.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git
   cd caesar-cipher
